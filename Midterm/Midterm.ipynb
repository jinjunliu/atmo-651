    "# Introduction\n",
    "This project is to use a statistical model to predict the wind stress anomalies by sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA). The relationship can be represented as $\\boldsymbol{\\tau_s} = \\boldsymbol{C} \\boldsymbol{T}$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\tau_s}$ and $\\boldsymbol{T}$ are state vectors of wind stress anomolies and SSTA, respectively, and $\\boldsymbol{C}$ is a constant coefficient (a matrix). Our goal is to derive $\\boldsymbol{C}$ using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) analysis on a training dataset, and apply the relationship on a testing dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is going to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Formulate a statistical atmosphere model for predicting surface wind stress anomalies for given SST anomalies;\n",
    "2. Validate the simulated surface wind stress anomalies against observations;\n",
    "3. Perform sensitivity tests to see how the results depend on the number of SVDs used to compute the anomalies;\n",
    "4. Discuss whether the results make physical sense and why;"

    "# Dataset and Method\n",
    "Surface temperature ($T_s$), zonal wind stress ($u$), meridional wind stress ($v$), and a land mask dataset are given. $T_s, u, v$ are three-dimensional, with two space dimensions and one time dimension. Datasets are divided into two parts: data in 1948-1999 are used as training dataset, and data in 2000-2017 are used as testing dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "We follow the following steps to perform the SVD analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Normalize all the anomaly fields by dividing each of variables by its own standard deviation;\n",
    "2. Form a state vector for SSTA ($\\boldsymbol{T}$), and another one for zonal and meridional wind stress anomaly ($\\boldsymbol{\\tau_s}$). Note that $\\boldsymbol{\\tau_s}$ contains both wind stress component and has larger dimension than $\\boldsymbol{T}$;\n",
    "3. Form a normalized covariance matrix, $\\boldsymbol{A=\\tau _s T'}$, whose dimension should be $M\\times N$, where $M$ is the length for $\\boldsymbol{\\tau_s}$ and $N$ is length for $\\boldsymbol{T}$;\n",
    "4. Apply SVD on $\\boldsymbol{A}$ by calling Matlabâ€™s SVD function, which results in $\\boldsymbol{A=USV'}$, $S$ is a diagonal matrix with diagonal elements representing singular values - explained squared covariance in each SVD, $\\boldsymbol{U}$ contains all wind stress singular vectors and $V$ contains all SST singular vectors, which are self-orthogonal, i.e., $\\boldsymbol{VV'=I}$ and $\\boldsymbol{UU'=I}$.
