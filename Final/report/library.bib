Predictors in three geographical locations are used: the tropical Pacific Ocean, the tropical Pacific and Indian oceans, and the global tropical oceans. Predictions did not depend crucially on any of these three domains, and evidence was found to support the assumption that linear dynamics dominates most of the record. The prediction model performs better when SST anomalies are rapidly evolving than during warm events when large anomalies persist. The rms prediction error at a lead time of 9 months is about half a degree Celsius.]},

@article{Penland1996,
   abstract = {It is often desirable to represent a rapidly varying physical process as stochastic forcing of some slower dynamical system. A review of this approximation is presented. The white-noise limit of rapidly varying processes reduces the dynamical description of the affected slower systems to stochastic differential equations, the properties of which are summarized. As an application of stochastic differential equations, we review the evidence that IndoPacific sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) can be represented as a stable linear process driven by spatially coherent stochastic forcing. An "inverse-modeling" approach is used. That is, the relevant parameters of the best-fit stable linear process are obtained from observations and, given these parameters, the assumptions of stability and linearity are subsequently tested. An "optimal initial structure" for growth, predicted by the model, is found to occur approximately seven months before most of the major warm and cold (El Niño/La Niña) events in the data record. The optimal structure preferentially occurs in the boreal spring, with the mature phase of the extreme event occurring in the subsequent late fall/winter. The best model to fit the observations, including the dependence of the dynamical system on the annual cycle, is driven by stochastic forcing with periodic statistics. These statistics are inferred using a time-dependent fluctuation-dissipation relation. The variation of the stochastic forcing with the annual cycle is not the same as that of the optimal initial structure. Yet, when a linear numerical model is driven with the derived stochastic forcing, the optimal structure, including its variation with the annual cycle, is recovered. This implies that deterministic dynamics play an important role in setting up the optimal structure and, therefore, a mature phase of El Niño may be predicted before the optimal structure actually appears.

@article{McPhaden2006,
   abstract = {The El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle of alternating warm El Niño and cold La Niña events is the dominant year-to-year climate signal on Earth. ENSO originates in the tropical Pacific through interactions between the ocean and the atmosphere, but its environmental and socioeconomic impacts are felt worldwide. Spurred on by the powerful 1997-1998 El Niño, efforts to understand the causes and consequences of ENSO have greatly expanded in the past few years. These efforts reveal the breadth of ENSO's influence on the Earth system and the potential to exploit its predictability for societal benefit. However, many intertwined issues regarding ENSO dynamics, impacts, forecasting, and applications remain unresolved. Research to address these issues will not only lead to progress across a broad range of scientific disciplines but also provide an opportunity to educate the public and policy makers about the importance of climate variability and change in the modern world.},

@article{Knight2006,
   abstract = {The Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) is a near-global scale mode of observed multidecadal climate variability with alternating warm and cool phases over large parts of the Northern Hemisphere. Many prominent examples of regional multidecadal climate variability have been related to the AMO, such as North Eastern Brazilian and African Sahel rainfall, Atlantic hurricanes and North American and European summer climate. The relative shortness of the instrumental climate record, however, limits confidence in these observationally derived relationships. Here, we seek evidence of these links in the 1400 year control simulation of the HadCM3 climate model, which produces a realistic long-lived AMO as part of its internal climate variability. By permitting the analysis of more AMO cycles than are present in observations, we find that the model confirms the association of the AMO with almost all of the above phenomena. This has implications for the predictability of regional climate.},

   abstract = {Data for the 20th century from the International Comprehensive Ocean and Atmosphere Data Set and the Kobe Collection have been used as input data for global objective analyses of sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) and other marine meteorological variables. This study seeks a better understanding of the historical marine meteorological data and an evaluation of the quality of the data in the Kobe Collection. Objective analyses yield gridded data that are less noisy than observed data, which facilitates handling of historical data. The observed data determine the quality of the objective analyses, and quality control specified for historical data is incorporated into the objective analysis to reduce artificial errors. The objective analyses are based on optimum interpolation and reconstruction with empirical orthogonal functions. The final database produced in this study not only contains analysed values, but also analysis errors and data distributions at each time step of the objective analyses. The analysis database contains amp le information on historical observations, as well as signals of marine climate variations during the century. Time series of global mean marine temperatures and cloud cover include trends linked to global warming, and local peaks appear commonly in all the time series around the 1940s. Sea-level pressure and sea-surface wind fields show significant linear trends at high latitudes and over the North Pacific Ocean respectively. These trends seem to be artificial. An SST analysis used widely in climatological studies was verified against HadISST from the Hadley Centre and an SST analysis derived from satellite and in situ observations. El Niño and southern oscillation indices for the century are successfully reproduced, even though observations in the tropics are much rarer before 1950 than after 1950.
